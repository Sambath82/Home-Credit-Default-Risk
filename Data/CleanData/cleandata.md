To get the clean data, simply follow the steps outlined in all the notebooks in the "Notebook" folder. Be sure to use the `replicate_instruction` file to guide you through each step. For added convenience, you can set up the directory for all the necessary files using the `notebook_setup.py` script, which is also located in the same folder. This will make everything nice and easy to manage!
